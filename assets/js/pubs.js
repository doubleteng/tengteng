abstract = {This paper aims to advance the field of additive manufacturing by producing multimaterial objects with intricate topological features and polylithic material distribution through an integrated approach. First, we develop a Single-Nozzle Multi-Filament (SNMF) system equipped with active mixing to blend multiple filaments and deposit a programmable mixture. The system can also deposit gradient transitions between different materials within a single print. Second, we establish a numerical model to represent the material transitional behavior and validated it with experiments. The model enables the precise control of the material transitional interface to ensure high material fidelity. Third, we propose three strategies for designing and modeling multimaterial objects catering to different application scenarios, including image sampling, 2D discrete patches, and 3D surface division. The system’s capabilities were validated through six case studies designed and fabricated through the above approaches for distinct application scenarios, demonstrating the successful materialization of complex designs with multiple functionalities.}

abstract = {Agarose uniquely forms moldable biodegradable films, making it a promising renewable material with exceptional biocompatibility, thermo-reversibility, and flexibility. However, agarose films lose most of their flexibility at low moisture content. One way to assuage this issue is to incorporate plasticizing agents. In this study, four plasticizers (i.e., sucrose, urea, glucose, and glycerol) were chosen and combined in various concentrations and combinations to produce an agarose-based composite. The study examined how four different plasticizers affect agarose's intermolecular interactions, impacting its mechanical, morphological, thermal, and physicochemical properties. Techniques like Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), X-ray Scattering, electric actuation, and tensile testing were used to analyze the effects of plasticizers on agarose-based films. The findings reveal that the mechanical and thermal properties of agarose films are influenced to varying degrees by the four plasticizers studied. Plasticizers with high hydroxyl content and smaller molecular size demonstrated the most significant improvements in film flexibility and stretchability. These variations in performance can be attributed to differences in intermolecular interactions, driven by changes in hydrogen bonding groups, as observed through FTIR and X-ray Scattering analyses. A deeper understanding of how hydrogen bonds affect the agarose-plasticizer matrix could pave the way for precisely tailoring the properties of agarose films.}
